Chess Overlays

Mark squares based on which pieces are currently threatening it. 

Squares will show up in blue if one or more of white's pieces can move there in the next turn. Squares will show up in red if one or more of black's pieces can move there in the next turn.
Symbols denoting which black pieces are attacking the square will show up on the top left of the square, and symbols denoting the same for white pieces will show up on the bottom right.

Situations like pins are not factored in, so a piece that is pinned to your king will still show up as threatening all the squares that it can normally move to.
